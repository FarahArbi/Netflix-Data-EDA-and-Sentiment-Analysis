# Analyzing Netflix Data - Data Exploration and Sentiment Analysis 

**Netflix**! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into one of the largest entertainment and media companies.

## Project Overview:
This project uses Python to explore and analyze the Netflix content catalog, focusing on uncovering trends in content type, genres, countries of production, and other key attributes. Through data visualization and summary statistics, the project seeks to answer the following questions:
- What is the distribution of content types (movies vs TV shows) on Netflix?
- Who are the most prolific directors and actors featured on Netflix?
- Which countries contribute the most content to Netflix's library?

The analysis is conducted using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn in a Jupyter Notebook: notebook.ipynb
